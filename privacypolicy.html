    <div class="content">
      <p>By using our bots, You agree to both the Terms of Service & Privacy Policy</p>
      <p>This article may be updated in the future.</p>
	  <p>To opt out of your data being collected, disable any features you do not want to use.</p>
	  <h2 class="section-title">General Data Collection</h2>
	  <p>Our Discord Bots store certain Channel IDs, Server IDs, User IDs, Message IDs and possibly names in order for most of it's functions and features to work. These values are only accessed and used by the bot itself and not accessed by our team unless needed or unless given permission to. The values specified are publicly available and are not sensitive information or private credentials. 
	  <p>While we do not directly store message content, we do store message content stored inside of tickets created with our bots in order to create a transcript. This feature can be disabled by simply not setting a transcript channel. However, if you do set a transcript channel, we have a strict policy to delete the data stored after 20 - days. (This does not include the transcript sent to the transcript channel!).
    <p>As stated above: Since we do not directly store message content, we forward it to the different channels when needed. (Example: our modmail system) To opt out, simply disable the features! (Some features are automatically turned off) By running the dedicated commands to disable these features, all data associated with it, will be deleted. We will also not be able to recover that information, when deleted. If you are planning on disabling features, remember you will lose all your data!
	  <h2 class="section-title">Logging</h2>
	  <p>We log every comamand that is executed using our bots, this information gets sent to us directly and we view them to verify no one is breaking our guidelines. This information consists of: The user that the command is executed on, The reason / message that is added, the server the command is ran in, the user who ran the command and any other field that is included with the command. None of this information is sensitive or private, it only is if you input private information into the fields. (Which is not encouraged or recommended)
	  <p>We do this to make sure everyone is following our guidelines and to make sure nothing is going wrong.
